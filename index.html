We are doing this via discussion groups all over the world. These groups will become friendship and knowledge exchange groups and will begin the important dialogue that will help us understand the new technologies that are here and coming; Graphene, living architecture, ion drive, satelites in space that can detect global warming and building a city on Mars.

		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Wow, how disgusting can they get? That is an unthinkable action, but there must be a reason behind it … They astronauts can not afford to take tons of water up into space with them. Can you believe that launching a single Kilogram into space can cost over $10,000? That’s why none of the water on the International Space Station is wasted, even the astronaut’s own pee.</p>

		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Imagine waking up in the morning, going to the kitchen and getting an instant breakfast from your 3D printer. That dream is slowly becoming a reality. NASA is funding a project that will help turn a 3D printer into a “space-kitchen”. Astronauts will use the 3D printer on long space flights to “cook” their foods. Pre-cooked meals don’t last very long and aren’t sustainable for long space missions, but now there's a solution! </p>
