		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Wow, how disgusting can they get? That is an unthinkable action, but there must be a reason behind it … They astronauts can not afford to take tons of water up into space with them. Can you believe that launching a single Kilogram into space can cost over $10,000? That’s why none of the water on the International Space Station is wasted, even the astronaut’s own pee.</p>

		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Imagine waking up in the morning, going to the kitchen and getting an instant breakfast from your 3D printer. That dream is slowly becoming a reality. NASA is funding a project that will help turn a 3D printer into a “space-kitchen”. Astronauts will use the 3D printer on long space flights to “cook” their foods. Pre-cooked meals don’t last very long and aren’t sustainable for long space missions, but now there's a solution! </p>
