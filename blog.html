		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Wow, how disgusting can they get? That is an unthinkable action, but there must be a reason behind it … They astronauts can not afford to take tons of water up into space with them. Can you believe that launching a single Kilogram into space can cost over $10,000? That’s why none of the water on the International Space Station is wasted, even the astronaut’s own pee.</p>

		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">Imagine waking up in the morning, going to the kitchen and getting an instant breakfast from your 3D printer. That dream is slowly becoming a reality. NASA is funding a project that will help turn a 3D printer into a “space-kitchen”. Astronauts will use the 3D printer on long space flights to “cook” their foods. Pre-cooked meals don’t last very long and aren’t sustainable for long space missions, but now there's a solution!</p>

		    <p class="blog-content animated zoomIn">You heard that right. The majority of the astronauts on the International Space Station have stated that they are suffering from swelling in parts of their brains. In space, there is no gravity, so the water and fluids that are normally spread out throughout your entire body end up going to the top of your body, your brain. What can scientists do to solve this problem?</p>
